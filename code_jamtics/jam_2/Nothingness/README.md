# Nothingness

A game where you move around using your mouse to eat dots and grow, dots try to spawn outside of your view and increase in size as the player grows.

## What I learnt

1. Using particles for the weird background dots
2. Tried messing around with shaders but gave up on that
3. Using a signal for when the player eats a dot
4. Creating a main menu and switching scenes

## What I could've done better

1. Visuals I guess but meh
2. Scale camera zoom depending on size? UI indicator for the actual size?
3. Have dots eat other dots and grow with you
4. Random dot movement
5. Test Godot before starting the jam
